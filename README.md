# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Application

## Description

The kNN application implements the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a versatile machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks.

## Key Features

-   **Classification and Regression**: Supports both classification and regression tasks by predicting outcomes based on nearest neighbors.
-   **Simplicity**: kNN is easy to understand and implement, making it ideal for beginners and rapid prototyping.
-   **Non-parametric**: Makes no assumptions about data distribution, ensuring flexibility in various data environments.
-   **Lazy Learning**: Memorizes the training dataset and performs predictions at runtime, enhancing efficiency.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization through tuning of parameters like \( k \) and distance metrics for improved performance.
-   **Scalability**: While suitable for moderate-sized datasets, kNN can be optimized for larger datasets with efficient indexing.

## Use Cases

-   **Classification**: Spam detection, handwriting recognition, recommendation systems.
-   **Regression**: Predicting housing prices, stock values, or weather patterns.
-   **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers or unusual patterns in data.

## Usage

-   Implement the kNN algorithm by importing functions from the provided codebase or develop it from scratch.
-   Optimize performance on specific datasets through hyperparameter tuning, experimenting with different \( k \) values and distance metrics.
-   For classification tasks, ensure proper dataset labeling and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dependencies

-   The kNN application may depend on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn (for Python) or similar algorithms in other programming languages.
